 Regarding limitations on commercial profit, excluding files, modification,
 swiping and so on, do what you wish. Using this in your own software
 does not obligate you to publish your source code. Contacting me is
 unnecessary. (However, I would be delighted if you could let me
 know you are using it (ha)).
 .
 I am not waiving copyright (not that I could even if I wanted to in this
 country). But, well, please use it as you wish (ha).
